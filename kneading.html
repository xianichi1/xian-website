    <h2>What Is Kneading?</h2>
    <p>Kneading—also known as “making biscuits”—is when cats press their paws into soft surfaces, often while purring. But why do they do it?
        Kneading begins in kittenhood. Nursing kittens instinctively knead their mother’s belly to stimulate milk flow. Some experts believe this action also releases oxytocin, a bonding hormone.
        As cats grow, they often carry this behavior into adulthood. It’s part of something called neoteny, where animals retain youthful traits. Adult cats tend to knead soft objects—or even their favorite people—when they feel safe, affectionate, or content.
        Kneading also stretches their muscles and activates scent glands in their paws. So yes—your cat is happily claiming you as theirs. Some cats even drool during kneading!
        If your cat kneads on you, take it as a compliment. Just be mindful of claws—trim them if needed, or grab a blanket for protection. And remember, not all cats knead—but that doesn’t mean they don’t love you. They show affection in many different ways.</p>

    <h2>Why Do They Do It?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Instinct from kittenhood:</strong> Kittens knead their mother to stimulate milk flow. It’s a comforting action they carry into adulthood.</li>
      <li><strong>Marking territory:</strong> Cats have scent glands in their paws, so kneading releases their scent to claim their spot.</li>
      <li><strong>Comfort and relaxation:</strong> Many cats knead when they’re happy, sleepy, or feeling safe.</li>
      <li><strong>Showing affection:</strong> If your cat kneads on you, it’s likely a sign of love and trust.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Should I Be Concerned?</h2>
    <p>Kneading is totally normal and healthy behavior. However, some cats may knead with their claws out, which can be a little painful! Providing a blanket or soft surface helps protect your skin while keeping your cat comfy.</p>

    <p>And remember, if your cat’s kneading becomes obsessive or unusual, it never hurts to check in with your vet.</p>
